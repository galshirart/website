<h3 class="subtitle">Running a branding agency without the downsides of a branding agency</h3>

<p>
There’s nothing I like to do more than designing logos for companies and helping entrepreneurs shape the identity of their brands. Branding has historically been dominated by mega agencies and it’s a big challenge to break through as an independent designer.
</p>

<p>
  I decided to flip the script and rethink the ideal way to run and deliver a branding process, which is entirely centered around what the client needs. My goal is to remove the pain and friction many startups feel when working with agencies and provide the absolute best result in a seamless process. 
</p>

<p>
  After working in the design space for 10+ years (yes, also with some of these agencies), I decided to adopt an alternative model. A model that provides the essential value of a branding agency, without the downsides of a branding agency.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="tldr">TL;DR</span> By focusing only on what matters and leaving the bullshit aside, I'm achieving a win-win situation for me and the client. I get to work only on what I excel at, and the clients receive the best value for their money. I charge a 25% upfront payment and the client only pays the remaining 75% if they’re happy with the result. A model that has been proven fair and successful across 100% of the clients I worked with since launching the agency in mid-2023. 
</p>


<p>
Ideally, after I finish a logo for a client, they end up hiring a full-time product/marketing designer to work on the implementation of the visual language and guidelines I've provided for the long term. Someone who has the time to deeply understand the brand's products and can take full ownership.
</p>


<h3>I only do one meeting</h3>

<p>
Traditional branding agencies usually provide you with a fancy timeline of multiple meetings that you have to attend. It might give a sense of control and professionalism, but also raises many questions about whether these meetings are actually important for the process, or just there to give you the impression that they are.
